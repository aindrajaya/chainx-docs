## Setting up your environment

Before you can start scanning smart contracts, you need to set up your local development environment.

### Install Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js (version 12 or later) and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Clone the repository

Clone the ChainX API repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aindrajaya/chainx-api.git
```

### Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd chainx-api
npm install
```

### Start the server

Start the API server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Scan your first smart contract

Now that your environment is set up, you can scan your first smart contract.

### Generate an API key

First, generate an API key using the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-domain.com/api/generate-api-key \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "production"}'
```

Replace `"production"` with `"test"` if you want a test API key.

The response will contain your API key:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

### Scan a smart contract

Use the `/api/v1/scan` endpoint to scan your smart contract. You'll need to include your API key in the request header.

Here's an example cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1/scan \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/smart-contract.sol"
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key and `/path/to/your/smart-contract.sol` with the path to your Solidity file.

### View the results

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the scan results, including the number of vulnerabilities found and details about each vulnerability.

## Next steps

Now that you've scanned your first smart contract, you can explore the other features of the ChainX API, such as AI-powered scanning and security best practices.
