# Troubleshooting & FAQ

## Common API Errors & Solutions

### 400 Bad Request - No File Uploaded

**Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "No file uploaded."
}
```

**Causes:**
- File parameter not included in request
- Form data not properly formatted
- File doesn't exist at specified path

**Solutions:**
```bash
# ❌ Wrong - missing file parameter
curl -X POST https://chainx-api-a154bfdeaf7a.herokuapp.com/api/v1/scan \
  -H "X-API-Key: prod-chainx-abc123..."

# ✅ Correct - include file parameter
curl -X POST https://chainx-api-a154bfdeaf7a.herokuapp.com/api/v1/scan \
  -H "X-API-Key: prod-chainx-abc123..." \
  -F "file=@./contracts/Token.sol"
```

{
  "error": "File size exceeds maximum limit of 1048576 bytes. Upload a smaller file."
}
```

**Causes:**
- File larger than plan's limit
- Contract code exceeds character limit

**Solutions:**

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your@email.com"
  }'
```

## Scanning Issues

### Scan Returns Empty Results

**Causes:**
- Contract is actually secure (no vulnerabilities)
- File format issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify contract has content
wc -l contract.sol

# Verify it's valid Solidity
solc contract.sol
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://openrouter.ai
# 2. Include in request
curl -X POST https://chainx-api-a154bfdeaf7a.herokuapp.com/api/v1/ai-scan \
  -H "X-API-Key: prod-chainx-abc123..." \
  -F "file=@contract.sol" \
  -F "openrouterApiKey=sk-or-v1-..." \
  -F "model=google/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05:free"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does a scan take?

**A:** Most scans complete in 1-5 seconds. Large contracts (>1MB) may take longer. Pro plans have priority processing.

---

### Q: Will my contract code be stored?

**A:** No, we process files in memory and don't permanently store contract code. Files are deleted immediately after scanning.

---

### Q: Can I scan private/internal contracts?

**A:** Yes, you can scan contracts with any visibility level. We don't store or share code with anyone.

---

### Q: What languages are supported?

**A:** Currently Solidity (.sol) files. Other languages coming soon.

---

### Q: Can I use API keys in CI/CD?

**A:** Yes. Store API keys as secrets in your CI/CD system (GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, etc.).

---

### Q: Do you support webhooks?

**A:** Yes, webhooks are available on Pro plans.

---

### Q: Can I get historical scan data?

**A:** Yes, retention varies by plan:
- Free plan: 7 days
- Basic plan: 30 days
- Pro plan: 90 days

---

### Q: What's the difference between standard and AI scans?

**Standard Scan:**
- Detects known SWC patterns
- Instant results (1-5 seconds)
- Security scoring
- Best for quick checks

**AI Scan:**
- Deep vulnerability analysis
- Security recommendations
- Detailed explanations
- Slower but more comprehensive

---

### Q: Can I integrate with my monitoring system?

**A:** Yes, use webhooks (Pro plan) or poll the API for results.

---

### Q: Do you provide professional audits?

**A:** We provide automated scanning. For professional audits, contact enterprise@chainx.id

---

### Q: How often do you update vulnerability patterns?

**A:** We update SWC pattern detection quarterly and continuously improve AI models.

---

### Q: What do I do if I can't remember my password?

**A:** Use the forgot password flow:
```bash
curl -X POST https://chainx-api-a154bfdeaf7a.herokuapp.com/api/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your@email.com"}'
```

A password reset link will be sent to your email.

---

### Q: Can I have multiple API keys?

**A:** Yes, you can generate multiple API keys for different environments (production, testing, development).

---

### Q: Are there any rate limits I should know about?

**A:** Yes, rate limits vary by plan:
- Free: 60 requests/hour, 5 scans/day
- Basic: 600 requests/hour, 100 scans/day
- Pro: 6000 requests/hour, 1000 scans/day

---

### Q: How do I know if I've reached my daily scan limit?

**A:** You'll receive a 429 error with a message indicating when your limit resets (typically at 00:00 UTC).

---

### Q: Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan anytime?

**A:** Yes, you can change your plan anytime from your account dashboard. Changes take effect immediately.

```bash
# Stop the Cortex process
cortex stop
# Start the Cortex process
cortex
# Init the engine
cortex engines <engine_name> init
```

## Engine Installation Error

```bash
Installing engine . . .Error:EPERM: operation not permitted
```
This issue occurs when an engine runs in the background and you attempt to run a different engine without stopping the previous one.

To resolve this issue, follow the steps below:

```bash
# Stop the Cortex process
cortex stop
# Start the Cortex process
cortex
# Init the engine
cortex run <model_id>:<engine_name>
```

## 500 Status Code

"500 status code ("no body") indicates an internal server error with no additional details provided. This issue may occur for several reasons:

1. Cortex is running in low or insufficient VRAM hardware.
2. The engine version is outdated, while the model requires the latest version of the engine.

To resolve this issue:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
    To solve the insufficient VRAM:

    1. `cortex stop` to stop the Cortex process and model if you have started a model before. 
    2. To make sure the processes are terminated, open your **Task Manager**.
    3. Search for any **Jan** or **Cortex** processes → Terminate the tasks.
    4. Rerun `cortex`.

    To solve the error caused by the outdated engine version:

    1. Re-initialize the engine that you want to use:

    ```bash
    # ONNX Engine
    cortex engines onnx init
    # TensorRT-LLM Engine
    cortex engines tensorrt-llm init
    ```

    2. Rerun `cortex` → run the model you want to use.

    To solve the insufficient VRAM:
    1. `cortex stop` to stop the Cortex process and model if you have started a model before. 
    2. To make sure the processes are terminated, open your **Activity Monitor**.
    3. Search for any **Jan** or **Cortex** processes → **Terminate** the tasks.
    4. Rerun `cortex`.

    To solve the error caused by the outdated engine version:

    1. Re-initialize the engine that you want to use:

    ```bash
    # ONNX Engine
    cortex engines onnx init
    # TensorRT-LLM Engine
    cortex engines tensorrt-llm init
    ```

    2. Rerun `cortex` → run the model you want to use.

## 426 Error Code

This issue occurs when a new Cortex process is started without fully stopping the previous Cortex processes. This causes a heavy load on port `39281` and requires a protocol upgrade.

To resolve this issue:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
```bash
# Check for network connections using port 1337 to find the Cortex PID.
netstat -an | findstr :1337

# Terminate Cortex process by its Process ID (PID).
taskkill /f /pid [pid]
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Mac" label="Mac" >
```bash
# Check for network connections using port 1337 to find the Cortex PID.
lsof -i :1337

# Terminate Cortex process by its Process ID (PID).
kill -9 [pid]
```
