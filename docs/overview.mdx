# ChainX Scanner API

:::info
**Real-world Use:**  This API can be integrated into development tools, CI/CD pipelines, or security analysis platforms to automate the process of identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. 

This API is currently under development. If you have any questions, please contact [arista.indrajaya@gmail.com](mailto:arista.indrajaya@gmail.com).
:::

ChainX Scanner API is a service that allows developers to scan their Solidity smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities.

**Key Features:**

*   **Automated Vulnerability Detection:**  Upload your smart contract and the API will automatically identify potential security risks.
*   **Fast and Efficient:** The API is designed to provide quick and efficient scanning, minimizing delays in your development process.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Integrate the API into your existing workflows using simple HTTP requests.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Includes rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## How to Use

1.  **Make a POST request to the `/scan` endpoint.**
2.  **Include the smart contract file in the request body as `multipart/form-data`.**

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F 'file=@path/to/your/contract.sol' \
  http://localhost:3000/scan  # Replace with your actual API URL


## API Endpoints
  - /scan (POST)
    Description: Uploads and scans a smart contract file for vulnerabilities.
    Request:
    - file: The smart contract file (.sol) to be uploaded.
    Response:
    - 200 OK:
      ```JSON
      {
        "success": "Smart contract scanned successfully",
        "file": "/path/to/uploaded/file.sol",
        "vulnerabilitiesCount": 2,
        "dataVulnerabilities": [
          { "vulnerabilityId": 1 },
          { "vulnerabilityId": 2 }
        ],
        "message": "This API has Rate limiter, if you want to use more further please contact me at email: arista.indrajaya@gmail.com"
      }
      ```
    - 400 Bad Request: Returned if no file is uploaded.
    - 500 Internal Server Error: Returned if an error occurs during the scan.

## Rate Limiting
The API has a rate limiter in place to prevent abuse. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive an error message.  For more usage, please contact arista.indrajaya@gmail.com.

## Future Enhancements
  - Detailed Vulnerability Reports: Provide more detailed information about each vulnerability, including its severity, description, and potential mitigation strategies.
  - Support for Additional File Types: Expand support to include other smart contract file types beyond Solidity (e.g., Vyper).
  - Integration with Development Tools: Develop plugins or integrations for popular development tools to streamline vulnerability scanning within common workflows.
